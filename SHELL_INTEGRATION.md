# Shell Integration Hooks - Module 5

## Overview

Module 5: Shell integration hooks has been successfully implemented, providing advanced shell interaction capabilities including command history tracking, prompt detection, and intelligent command completion.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Shell Type Detection
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects shell type based on the shell executable path
- **Supported Shells**:
  - PowerShell (powershell.exe, pwsh.exe)
  - Bash (bash)
  - Zsh (zsh)
  - Fish (fish)
  - Windows CMD (cmd.exe)

### 2. Prompt Detection
- **Smart Prompt Recognition**: Uses regex patterns to identify shell prompts
- **Multi-Shell Support**: Different patterns for each shell type
- **Working Directory Extraction**: Automatically extracts current working directory from prompts
- **Real-time Status**: Tracks whether the terminal is at a prompt or running a command

### 3. Command History Tracking
- **Automatic Command Detection**: Identifies when commands are executed
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Stores command text, timestamp, working directory, duration, and exit codes
- **History Management**: Maintains a rolling history with configurable size limits
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search through command history

### 4. Command Completion System
- **History-Based Suggestions**: Suggests commands based on previously executed commands
- **Frequency Analysis**: Prioritizes frequently used commands
- **Shell-Specific Commands**: Built-in suggestions for common shell commands
- **Tab Completion**: Integration with shell tab completion mechanisms

### 5. User Interface Enhancements
- **Command Completion Dialog**: Interactive command completion with keyboard navigation
- **Command History Browser**: Full-featured command history viewer with search
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Ctrl+R`: Open command history
  - `Ctrl+Space`: Trigger command completion
  - `Tab`: Command completion when at prompt
  - `↑ Arrow`: Quick access to command history
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows when terminal is ready for commands

## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### `shell_hooks.rs`
- **ShellHooks**: Core logic for a single terminal session
  - Command detection and tracking
  - Prompt pattern matching
  - History management
  - Command suggestions
- **ShellHooksManager**: Manages shell hooks across all terminal sessions
- **Data Structures**:
  - `Command`: Represents an executed command with metadata
  - `PromptInfo`: Contains parsed prompt information
  - `CommandSuggestion`: Command completion suggestions with frequency data

#### Integration with Terminal Manager
- **Real-time Processing**: All terminal output is processed by shell hooks
- **Session Management**: Shell hooks are created/destroyed with terminal sessions
- **API Exposure**: Shell hooks functionality exposed through Tauri commands

### Frontend Components

#### `CommandCompletion.tsx`
- Interactive command completion interface
- Real-time suggestion fetching
- Keyboard navigation support
- Smart completion for commands vs file paths

#### `CommandHistory.tsx`
- Full command history browser
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Metadata display (timestamps, durations, exit codes)
- Keyboard navigation and selection

#### Enhanced Terminal Component
- **Smart Input Handling**: Tracks user input when at prompt
- **Context-Aware Features**: Only shows completion/history when appropriate
- **Keyboard Integration**: Seamless integration with shell shortcuts

## API Endpoints

### Tauri Commands

```rust
// Get command history for a terminal session
get_command_history(terminal_id: String, limit: Option<usize>) -> Vec<Command>

// Get command suggestions based on partial input
get_command_suggestions(terminal_id: String, partial_command: String) -> Vec<CommandSuggestion>

// Handle tab completion for current input
handle_tab_completion(terminal_id: String, current_line: String, cursor_pos: usize) -> Vec<String>

// Check if terminal is currently at a prompt
is_at_prompt(terminal_id: String) -> bool

// Get current prompt information
get_current_prompt(terminal_id: String) -> Option<PromptInfo>

// Search command history
search_history(terminal_id: String, query: String) -> Vec<Command>
```

## Shell-Specific Features

### PowerShell Integration
- **Cmdlet Recognition**: Detects PowerShell cmdlets (commands with hyphens)
- **Alias Support**: Recognizes common PowerShell aliases (ls, cd, pwd, etc.)
- **Path Extraction**: Parses working directory from PS prompts

### Unix Shell Integration
- **Multi-Shell Support**: Works with Bash, Zsh, and Fish
- **Prompt Variations**: Handles various prompt formats and customizations
- **Command Classification**: Intelligent command vs output differentiation

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Windows CMD**: Full support for Windows Command Prompt
- **Path Handling**: Proper path parsing for both Windows and Unix systems
- **Shell Detection**: Automatic shell type detection based on executable

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Command Completion**: Start typing a command and press `Tab` or `Ctrl+Space`
2. **Command History**: Press `Ctrl+R` or `↑ Arrow` to browse previous commands
3. **Search History**: Use the search box in command history to find specific commands
4. **Quick Selection**: Use arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select

### For Developers
- The shell hooks system is automatically initialized for each terminal session
- All shell integration features work transparently with the existing terminal emulation
- The API is designed to be extensible for future enhancements

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Pattern Matching**: Optimized regex patterns for prompt detection
- **Memory Management**: Rolling history with configurable size limits
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking command processing and suggestion generation
- **Debounced Suggestions**: Prevents excessive API calls during typing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced File Completion**: Integration with filesystem for file/directory completion
2. **Command Learning**: Machine learning-based command suggestions
3. **Cross-Session History**: Shared command history across terminal sessions
4. **Plugin System**: Extensible completion system for custom commands
5. **Syntax Highlighting**: Real-time command syntax highlighting
6. **Error Detection**: Intelligent error message parsing and suggestions

## Configuration

The shell integration system supports various configuration options:

- **History Size**: Maximum number of commands to store (default: 1000)
- **Suggestion Limit**: Maximum number of suggestions to show (default: 10)
- **Pattern Customization**: Custom prompt patterns for specialized shells
- **Completion Timeout**: Debounce timeout for suggestion fetching (default: 150ms)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for advanced shell integration features, bringing the Warp terminal closer to feature parity with modern terminal emulators while maintaining excellent performance and cross-platform compatibility.
